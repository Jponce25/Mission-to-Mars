# Mission-to-Mars

For this project we use Web scraping to automatically extract information about Mars for different active websites in order to be displayed in a web application that will scrape new data each time we click the "Scrape new data" button. 

for this task we use Chrome Developer Tools to identify HTML components and BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser to gather the data we need. We use MongoDB to store the data and Flask to display the data.

Also, we add some Bootstap and CSS code to improve the view of the web application, we add design to the images to change their size and shape, a design was added to the news information and to the facts table. Finally the code was also modified to add responsive for mobile devices.

## View of the web application.
